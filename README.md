# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is designed to be played in the terminal, allowing two players to take turns and compete against each other.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Fardeen/TicTacToeGame.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
 cd location where you cloned the repository



3. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file to start the game:
python tic_tac_toe.py


4. The game will display a 3x3 grid, numbered from 1 to 9, representing the positions on the board

5. Players take turns to enter their moves. The game will prompt the current player to enter a position number where they want to place their symbol (X or O).

6. To make a move, simply enter the position number and press Enter. The updated board will be displayed after each move.

7. The game will continue until one of the players wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

8. At the end of the game, the players have the option to play again or exit the game.
